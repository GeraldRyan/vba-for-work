# VBA-for-work


The file called "main" is a macro designed for use with Practice Management for time reports to be able to make a quick pivot table off of them, specifically Employees> Employee Client Services saved as .xlsx

It requires specific file formatting that might be only useful at our firm, maybe even for one manager, who commissioned me to make it, but it is useful to her, and besides, there may be other useful subroutines in there. 

In the medical branches and MedicalOptimized in particular (or whichever it happens to be; Just look for the most current), there is a useful macro project in the file called "ForMedical" for copying values from a pivot table to all the doctor worksheets- intended to save hours of time and tedious effort. I made it as robust and dynamic as I could, user friendly, with data validation, convenience functions (where missing, to auto create new doctor worksheets upon user clicking "yes"), etc etc. I optimized it as much as I could for speed and efficiency, and am always looking to refactor and improve working code. 

THis repo is messy, I know. It was useful for me for backing up working code, but it is also messy, with so many branches because I was experimenting and learning how to use Git and Github in practice, and I am still learning the concepts and techniques, but I like experimenting and I am a novice, so that is one reason it is kind of messy and not perfectly structured- all apologies. 

I also have a bunnch of other macro functions that are pretty short and simple but are useful to just about anyone who uses excel if they can intuit what their function is. They save me time and energy, little by little, in my day to day. Of course, macros are "dangerous" as there's no going back, but I love to live dangerously. 

Enjoy
